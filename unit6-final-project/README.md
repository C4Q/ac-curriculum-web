# Unit 6: Final Project and How Software Actually Works

1. Large group project to build a full stack web application that includes:
 - A secure user login system
 - Dynamic page renders depending on user logged in, user state, input queries
 - Client side has sufficiently complicated user experience; not necessarily a pure single-page app, but has numerous async interactions with the server, as well as dynamically updating content without a page refresh
 - Consumption of an external API (like Facebook, Twilio, Stripe, etc.)
 - Usage of a permanent data store (SQL and/or NoSQL store) to maintain state beyond individual user sessions
 - Inclusion of open source libraries and tools from npm
 - IDEA: Bring in volunteer designers and product managers to help students build out their projects, letting them focus on the software
 - **Learning outcome**: Professional feeling, significantly complicated, dynamic website with server side data
2. Computer Science and Operating System Structures
 - Memory management, Stack, Heap, Code
 - Binary, signed and unsigned integers, two's complement, floats
 - Compilers and Assembly
 - Threading, mutexes, event/run loops
