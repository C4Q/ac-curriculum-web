# Unit 4: Building Full Stack Web Applications

### Week 1

- Agile processes and methodology: 2 days
  - Daily standups
  - Weekly sprints, sprint planning and sprint retrospectives
  - Stories, story points, and tickets
  - Bug duty and backlog grooming
  - Quarterly planning and KPIs
  - **Learning outcome**: Can speak the corporate speak about "moving the needle for the business", sound informed in an interview setting
  - **Learning outcome**: First mock interview including DS&A technical questions as well as behavioral questions
- Automated testing: 3 days
 - Jasmine (or better?) framework for executing unit tests
 - Dependency injection and mocks, concept and frameworks
 - Selenium (or better?) framework for executing full stack browser tests
 - [TestPyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html): Knowing it and understanding why
 - Continuous integration (and delivery) theory and common systems (Jenkins, TeamCity, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc.)
 - **Learning outcome**: Given some code, extract its external dependencies via DI and implement some unit tests with mocks
 - **Learning outcome**: Can talk shop about CI, understand and explain the value of adding CI to a release workflow, can argue convincingly for the inclusion of tests and CI into the development process

### Week 2

- Pair programming: 1 day
  - Understand and explain the purpose of pairing
  - Apply simple pairing patterns like Driver/Navigator and ping-pong
  - Verbally establish a productive pairing arrangement
  - Give specific, actionable, and kind feedback to pairing partner
  - Shamelessly copied from [Turing.io](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_01-object_oriented_programming_with_ruby/pairing_patterns.markdown)
  - **Learning outcome**: Have a successful ping-pong session writing both tests and code that passes the tests
- Full stack web application large solo project: 4 days
  - E-commerce platform [Turing.io's Black Thursday](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown)
  - Break down a project into components
  - Use tests to verify correctness, and text fixtures and test data to iterate quickly
  - Leverage the agile process
  - **Learning outcome**: Professional feeling, significantly complicated, dynamic website with server side data that simulates e-commerce

### Week 3



### Week 4

- Review: 4 days
- Final Assessment: .5 days
- Project presentations: .5 days

### Remaining stuff to be integrated

1. Large solo/group project to build a full stack web application that includes:
 - A secure user login system
 - Dynamic page renders depending on user logged in, user state, input queries
 - Client side has sufficiently complicated user experience; not necessarily a pure single-page app, but has numerous async interactions with the server, as well as dynamically updating content without a page refresh
 - Example projects: Twitter clone, Yelp clone, Google Maps directions service, etc.
 - IDEA: Bring in volunteer designers and product managers to help students build out their projects, letting them focus on the software
  - **Learning outcome**: Professional feeling, significantly complicated, dynamic website with server side data


4. Data structures and algorithms practice
 - What is the best datastructure to use for situation S?
 - What datastructure has performance P for operation O?
 - What is the performance of operation O on datastructure D?
 - Build an autocomplete system on the server and fetch results as the user types on the client (trees)
 - Implement BFS and DFS (using a queue and recursion respectively)
 - Whiteboard coding
 - Whiteboard software design
 - **Learning outcome**: Be able to pass mock interviews with volunteer industry professionals focused on whiteboard coding and DS&A problems
 - **Learning outcome**: Able to complete majority of Cracking the Coding Interview practice problems
