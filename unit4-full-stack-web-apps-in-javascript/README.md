# Unit 4: Building Full Stack Web Applications

1. Large solo/group project to build a full stack web application that includes:
 - A secure user login system
 - Dynamic page renders depending on user logged in, user state, input queries
 - Client side has sufficiently complicated user experience; not necessarily a pure single-page app, but has numerous async interactions with the server, as well as dynamically updating content without a page refresh
 - Example projects: Twitter clone, Yelp clone, Google Maps directions service, etc.
 - *Learning outcome*: Professional feeling, significanlty complicated, dynamic website with server side data
2. Agile processes and methodology
 - Daily standups
 - Weekly sprints, sprint planning and sprint retrospectives
 - Stories, story points, and tickets
 - Bug duty and backlog grooming
 - Quarterly planning and KPIs
 - *Learning outcome*: Can speak the corporate speak about "moving the needle for the business", sound informed in an interview setting
3. Automated testing
 - Jasmine (or better?) framework for executing unit tests
 - Dependency injection and mocks, concept and frameworks
 - Selenium (or better?) framework for executing full stack browser tests
 - [TestPyramid](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html)
 - Continuous integration (and delivery) theory and common systems (Jenkins, TeamCity, TravisCI, CircleCI, etc.)
 - *Learning outcome*: Given some code, extract its external dependencies via DI and implement some unit tests with mocks
 - *Learning outcome*: Can talk shop about CI, understand and explain the value of adding CI to a release workflow, can argue convincingly for the inclusion of tests and CI into the development process
4. Data structures and algorithms practice
 - Best datastructure to use for situation X
 - Build an autocomplete system on the server and fetch results as the user types on the client (trees)
 - Implement BFS and DFS
