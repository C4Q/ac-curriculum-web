# Unit 3: Server Side MVC Application Development using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL

1. Express and MVC
 - Why MVC for server side development
 - Routing
 - Controllers
 - Views using a templating engine and View Models (Mustache? Jade?)
 - Middleware for session, error handling, 
 - *Learning outcome*: Create a website with over 4 unique URL routes with both HTML and JSON responses, user state stored in sessions, and an interactive set of client pages using AJAX to hit at least one JSON endpoint
2. Databases, SQL, and PostgreSQL
 - What a database is, what "relational" means in the context of databases
 - How to insert, update, delete, and query using SQL syntax
 - How to set up PostgreSQL locally, and configure Express to interact with it
 - *Learning outcome*: Build a user login system in Express using PostgreSQL
3. Trees & Graphs
 - Binary trees: BSTs, Min/Max Heaps
 - N-ary trees: Tries, B-Trees
 - Graphs: Modeling social network, modeling subway trains
4. Recursion and BFS/DFS
