# Unit 3: Server Side MVC Application Development using Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL

### Week 1

- Serverside MVC with Express: 3 days
  - Why MVC for server side development
  - Separation of concerns
  - Routing, (simple) regular expressions
  - Controllers
  - Views using a templating engine and ViewModels (Mustache? Jade?)
  - Middleware for session, error handling, 
  - **Learning outcome**: Create a website with over 4 unique URL routes with both HTML and JSON responses, user state stored in sessions, and an interactive set of client pages using AJAX to hit at least one JSON endpoint

### Week 2

### Week 3

### Week 4

- Review: 2 days
- Final Assessment: .5 days
- Project presentations: .5 days

### TODO: content to be merged into the week

1. Express and MVC
 
2. Databases, SQL, and PostgreSQL
 - What a database is, what "relational" means in the context of databases
 - How to insert, update, delete, and query using SQL syntax
 - How to set up PostgreSQL locally, and configure Express to interact with it
 - **Learning outcome**: Build a user login system in Express using PostgreSQL
3. Trees & Graphs
 - Binary trees: BSTs, Min/Max Heaps, logarithmic runtime; how to implement using structures with pointers, or for Heaps with arrays
 - N-ary trees: Tries, B-Trees
 - In order, pre-order, post-order traversals
 - Graphs: Modeling social network, modeling subway trains; how to implement a graph
 - **Learning outcome**: Build a binary or n-ary tree node
 - **Learning outcome**: Identify the performance charateristics of a given implementation of a tree (insert, delete, lookup)
4. Recursion and BFS/DFS
 - Recursive mult, fibonnaci, sum
 - Translating iterative functions into recursive ones, and vice versa
 - Common problems that map to BFS: Find the shortest path to a node, find if two nodes are connected at all
 - Common problems that map to DFS: Find the value of the largest ancestor,
 - Understanding the call stack and being able to step through recursive implementations to understand current state
 - **Learning outcome**: Read and write recursive implementations of math and other common functions
 - **Learning outcome**: Understand runtime complexity and be able to explain why the app's complexity is 
5. Sorting
 - Quicksort & Merge sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Radix/Bucket sort
 - Runtime analysis
 - **Learning outcome**: Given an implementation, understand which sort it is
 - **Learning outcome**: Know the runtime of every common sort algorithm
 - **Learning outcome**: Implement Quicksort recursively
