# Unit 1: Intro to programming in Javascript

1. HTML & CSS
 - Tags: head, body, style, script, link, a, div, p, h1+, img, span, etc.
 - Attributes: class, name
 - Common CSS Properties: margin, padding, position, color, font-size, bg-color, etc.
 - CSS selectors
 - External libraries and stylesheets (bootstrap)
 - *Learning outcome*: Build a simple personal site with multiple pages and non-trivial layout
2. Git & GitHub
 - Command Line Git: clone, commit, pull, push
 - Branching and merging
 - GitHub pull request UX, how to converse on a PR
 - *Learning outcome*: Put simple personal site on GitHub, push to GitHub pages using GitBot.co
3. Programming basics in Javascript
 - Variables, control structures, loops, conditionals, functions
 - jQuery DOM manipulation
 - Creating interactive web pages using JavaScript
 - *Learning outcome*: Create a tic-tac-toe implementation that allows two players to play the game on a board by clicking on elements with correct win and lose conditions as well as restart buttons and local state keeping track of wins/losses
4. Lists vs Arrays
 - Big O notation, software performance analysis and optimization
 - Linked List C-style implementation (structs with pointers) and the performance implications
 - Array C-style implementation (fixed size contiguous memory) and the performance implications
 - *Learning outcome*: Be able to identify the superior data structure in various situations, and be able to identify the performance of all operations on both datastructures (ex: which datastructure has contant time update of an index? Which has constant time insert at the front? Which to use when building up an unknown number of items from empty? Which to use when the content is sorted and you want to search to see if a specific item is present? etc.)
5. Objects
 - Syntax for JS objects
 - Common uses for key-value mappings
 - HashTable C-style implementation (array of linked lists) and the performance implications
 - *Learning outcome*: Write a JavaScript function that takes an input an array and returns a new array with only the unique elements from the input. This should be O(n) time and preserve the order of the input array
 - *Learning outcome*: Create a vehicle lookup implementation that lets users lookup vehicles by name and display the different features of the vehicle on the page.
