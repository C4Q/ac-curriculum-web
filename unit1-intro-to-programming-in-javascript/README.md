 - More tags: script, link, style
 - Common CSS Properties: margin, padding, position, color, font-size, bg-color, etc.
 - CSS selectors: element, class, id, nested elements
 - Chrome Developer Tools: Inspector, CSS live editing
 - **Learning outcome**: Build a simple personal site with multiple pages and non-trivial layout

- **Review / work on project** (1 day)
  - Exercises covering concepts from first two weeks
  - Small group project reinforcing concepts
  - More Chrome Dev tools

- **Assessment** (1 day)
  

### Week 3

- JavaScript and the DOM using jQuery: 4 days
  - Using CSS Selectors to select jQuery DOM elements
  - Manipulating jQuery DOM elements with `.text()`, `.hide()`, `.show()`, `.attr()`, `.css()`
  - Creating new DOM elements with `.append()` and `.prepend()`
  - Reading and validating form content with `.val()`
  - Interacting with sets of jQuery DOM elements with `.each()`
  - Browser Events
    - Event handlers and the concept of callbacks (+ brief intro to asynchronous nature of javascript)
    - Event propagation: bubbling vs capture.
    - jQuery event handling methods: `.click()` vs `.on()`
    - Using event propagation to efficiently bind to dynamic elements ie: `.on('click', '.child-selector', cb)`
  - **Learning outcome**: Create a web page with multiple buttons with independent click event listeners
  - **Learning outcome**: Create a web page with a form that validates the input and has different behavior for valid and invalid input.
  - **Learning outcome**: Single webpage project ideas: Madlibs, Hangman, Math Quiz, Choose your own adventure game
- Big O notation, software performance analysis and optimization: 2 days (carries over into next week)
  - Understand O(1), O(n), O(n<sup>2</sup>), and how to combine by taking only the largest
  - Learn how to analyze functions for their runtime complexity, including calling other functions
  - Write programs to match runtime complexity and improve a given program's runtime complexity
  - Under the hood: List VS Arrays in non-JS context, performance characteristics of each
  - Linked List C-style implementation (structs with pointers) and the performance implications
  - Array C-style implementation (fixed size contiguous memory) and the performance implications
  - **Learning outcome**: Analyze a moderately complicated program to identify its runtime complexity (only with O(1), O(n), O(n<sup>2</sup>))
  - **Learning outcome**: Be able to identify the superior data structure in various situations, and be able to identify the performance of all operations on both datastructures (ex: which datastructure has contant time update of an index? Which has constant time insert at the front? Which to use when building up an unknown number of items from empty? etc.)


### Week 4

- Agile process for building software: 1 day
  - Project pre-broken up into many small deliverable iterations
  - Code reviews, pull requests, design reviews
  - Sprint planning, sprint retrospective, daily standups, story point sizing
  - **Learning outcome**: *TODO:* Using the agile process and closures, build a reasonably sized project (what should it be?)
- Review: 2 days
- Final Assessment: .5 days
- Project presentations: .5 days
