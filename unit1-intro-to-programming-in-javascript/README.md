# Unit 1: Intro to programming in Javascript

1. HTTP & HTML & CSS
 - What HTTP is, headers, content, envelope metaphor
 - Tags: head, body, style, script, link, a, div, p, h1+, img, span, etc.
 - Attributes: class, name
 - Common CSS Properties: margin, padding, position, color, font-size, bg-color, etc.
 - CSS selectors
 - External libraries and stylesheets (bootstrap)
 - *Learning outcome*: Build a simple personal site with multiple pages and non-trivial layout
2. Git & GitHub
 - Command Line Git: clone, commit, pull, push
 - Branching and merging
 - GitHub pull request UX, how to converse on a PR
 - *Learning outcome*: Put simple personal site on GitHub, push to GitHub pages using GitBot.co
3. Programming basics in Javascript
 - Variables, control structures, loops, conditionals, functions
 - jQuery DOM manipulation
 - Creating interactive web pages using JavaScript
 - *Learning outcome*: Create a tic-tac-toe implementation that allows two players to play the game on a board by clicking on elements with correct win and lose conditions as well as restart buttons and local state keeping track of wins/losses
4. Lists vs Arrays
 - Big O notation, software performance analysis and optimization
 - Linked List C-style implementation (structs with pointers) and the performance implications
 - Array C-style implementation (fixed size contiguous memory) and the performance implications
 - *Learning outcome*: Be able to identify the superior data structure in various situations, and be able to identify the performance of all operations on both datastructures (ex: which datastructure has contant time update of an index? Which has constant time insert at the front? Which to use when building up an unknown number of items from empty? Which to use when the content is sorted and you want to search to see if a specific item is present? etc.)
5. Debugging using Chrome developer tools
 - HTML and CSS Inspector
 - Breakpoints and stepping through code
 - Parsing call stack and watched variables
 - *Learning outcome*: Given a broken JavaScript program in a js file, use the Chrome Developer tools to identify where the bug is, and how to fix it
