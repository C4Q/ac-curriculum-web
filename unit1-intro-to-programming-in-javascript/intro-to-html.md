##Lecture
###What is HTML?
At its simplest, a web page could just be plain text, like you would type into a text editor. However, that’s pretty boring… The true power of the web comes from being able to easily link web pages together in a structured format. 

**Discussion** What’s the importance of having a standardized structure for web pages? What types of elements (e.g. headers, paragraphs) do we see repeatedly across different web pages? 

###Demo
- Start with a plain text document
- Add in `p` and `h1` tags
- Add an `a` tag

###Exercise 1
- What does HTML stand for?
- When was HTML invented?
- Why do we use a `p` tag instead of just plain text?
-  Which tags can we use to make headers of different sizes?
-  How would we embed a link to facebook.com in our web page?
- What do we put in the `body` tag? How is it different than the `head` tag?
-  What is the `script` tag used for? How is it different than the `link` tag?
-  What is the `div` tag used for?
- What tag can we use to group together HTML elements?
- What tags can we use to make a list?
- How do we include images in HTML pages?
- What is the `span` tag used for?
- What are some other examples of HTML tags?
- What is an HTML attribute?
- What is the `class` attribute used for?

###Exercise 1 Review
